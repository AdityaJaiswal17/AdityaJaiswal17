Hey there folks,

My name is Aditya Jaiswal, studying at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani campus, India. Im in my 3rd year of undergraduate studies in Mechanical engineering.
I like flying in turbulent flights (love the adrenaline rush?) and show a very specific interest with oxford commas :D (&,)

I love computational fluid dynamics and basically anything related to it because the simulations look beautiful and really colorful.
I know Lattice Boltzmann method (Thanks Dr. Tim Kr√ºger & Dr. Amol Subhedar) , Finite volume methods and Finite difference methods.

I learnt Lattice Boltzmann methods and its ways at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, where I did my research internship in the summer of 2023 and the manuscript is under preparation.
Also have an upcoming summer research internship at Indian Space Research organization (ISRO) in the summer of 2024.

I'm fascinated by jets, space shuttles and rockets and would totally do graduate studies in Aerospace engineering right after my undergraduate degree ends.
